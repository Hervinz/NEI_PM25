####This code reads a data set from he National Emissions Inventory (NEI).
#This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI).
#this is the information about emissions of fine particulate matter PM2.5.
#The goal is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database 
#and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states 
#over the 10-year period 1999-2008.
